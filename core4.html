<h1>The Core Four</h1>
<p> The core four are an effective and easy way to remeber the different part of code! <br>
  There are LOOPS, VARIABLES, CONDITIONALS, and FUNCTIONS. All of these components work together to build up your code.</p>

<h2>Loops</h2>
<p> Loops allow you to repeat a certain section of code either a certain amoutn of times, until something is "accomplished", or forever.

<h2>Variables</h2>
<p> Variales are similar to a placeholder. They store the information assigned to them and you can call this information by using the variable name.

<h2>Conditionals</h2>
<p>Conditionals are and effective way to execute and action IF something else happens. An easy way to remeber them is as an "if statement"

<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>Functions are used to shorten code. Once you name a function you can attach large strand of code to it, and rather than retyping the code to use again, you only need to call the function.
